Weather Web Application

This is a node.js application that allows the user to view the current weather conditions at their location, 
including a detailed weather forecast, air quality, and weather radar map. It uses Microsoft Bing Maps and 
Iowa State University's tile map service to display an animated weather map, Open Weather Map, and National
Weather Service APIs. It's a work in progress, but the structure is in place. All that is left to do is to 
add a few more features and make it pretty.
